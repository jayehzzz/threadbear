// Each scenario plays one thread and reads it three ways (helpers/routes.ts):
// on this runner, on another runner's thread from the Mac through Convex, and
// on the iPhone and the website. What a person sees (the card, its notes and
// pick, the follow-ups, the messages and their pictures) has to be the same
// on all three, or the difference has to be in KNOWN below with why. A
// decision card's notes (8 Nov) went missing on the way to another Mac with
// every test passing, as nothing compared the routes.
//
// A new feature that changes what a thread shows gets a scenario here. The
// agent building it writes it; it runs in the quick check in a second or two.
