// The installed app keeps itself on main, as the Swift app's AppUpdater does
// (core's app_update.rs has the rules). Twenty seconds after launch, every
// five minutes, and within seconds of main moving, it reads main's tree of
// desktop/ in the checkout it was built from, and when that differs from what's
// running it builds that commit into ~/Applications/.Threadbear GPUI.app.next
// (desktop/scripts/stage-update.sh, from the bundle). The Rust release build
// takes every core for minutes, so the script builds on a Mac among
// runner.json's updateBuildHosts and only the binaries come back. Check hosts
// never build it: what comes back is what runs here, and they're trusted only
// with tests (Daybreak 108). With check hosts but no update build hosts it
// builds nowhere and the Updates panel says so; with neither (someone else's
// copy) it builds here.
//
// Quitting swaps the staged bundle in, so the next launch is the new app; a
// launch that finds one staged (the app was killed rather than quit) swaps it
// in and starts again. Restart to Update, in the app menu and the Updates
// panel, does it now, and the app does it by itself once nothing typed would
// be lost and nothing under way cut off, then puts back the list and the
// thread he had open: straight away while Mike's in another app, and with the
// app in front once he hasn't touched it for five seconds.
//
// With the window on screen, the restart is a handover (handover.rs, as the
// Swift app's Handover.swift): the new build starts under the old window and
// takes its place once it's drawn, so the window never goes, and each
// thread's scroll place comes with it (`restore_state`). Mike keeps this app
// in front, so its updates never went in until he clicked (12 Nov); he'd
// rather it went in by itself, and with the handover it goes unseen.
